# TODO_APP
A Todo App built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in JavaScript to practice industry-standard coding patterns. The app supports adding, editing, deleting, marking todos as completed, real-time search, and a dark mode toggle. Data persists using localStorage for a lightweight, backend-free experience.
